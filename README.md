### 3D pose estimation of an RGBD camera using least squares technique


Optimization techniques are being used in many different fields and
applications, also it is known that the machine learning applications are heavily based on the
optimization theorems. One of the popular and fundamental algorithms in this field is Least squares
technique. Least squares are the basis of the SLAM technology which is being used by the mobile
robots of any kind.

This project demonstrates the usage of the least squares technique for estimation of an RGBD camrea; in particular the images which have been taken from the kinect.
